# Plans Directory

This directory contains planning documents created by Claude Code when working on complex tasks.

Plans are created in response to requests like:

- "Create a plan for implementing a new reward function"
- "Plan out how to refactor the environment setup"
- "Design an approach for LLM-based reward editing"

Each plan should be:

- **Skimmable**: Easy to read at a glance
- **Detailed**: Enough information for a new Claude instance to execute
- **Actionable**: Clear steps that can be followed
