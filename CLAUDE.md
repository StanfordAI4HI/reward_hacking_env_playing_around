**IMPORTANT**: Before doing any coding, read `CODING.md` for coding guidelines and follow all principles.
**IMPORTANT**: After writing any code, read the new code and ask "is there any redundancy? Could we simplify this while preserving functionality?" If so, formulate a plan and simplify the code.

## General Guidelines

- **Package manager**: Use **uv** (not pip/conda). Environment config in `pyproject.toml`
- When making bulk changes, write a script instead of making direct changes
- When running web searches, launch multiple search queries in parallel
- Run reading processes in parallel, especially when reading from multiple files or websites
- For repository-specific information (installation, architecture, commands), see **`README.md`**.
